# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description

This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank. Customer churn is when customers stop using a company's services or products. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not, and then take actions to prevent churn.

The project follows the following steps:

- Import the data
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Perform feature engineering
- Train models
- Evaluate and compare the performance of the models
- Save the best model

## Files and Data Description

The root directory contains the following files:

- `churn_library_solution.py`: A python file that contains the functions used in the project.
- `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`: A python file that contains test functions for the functions in `churn_library_solution.py`.
- `data/bank_data.csv`: A csv file that contains the data used in the project.
- `images/`: A directory that contains the images produced during exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.
- `models/`: A directory that contains the saved models.

## Running Files

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the `churn_library_solution.py` file to import the data, perform exploratory data analysis, perform feature engineering, and train the models.
4. Run the `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py` file to test the functions in `churn_library_solution.py`.
5. Check the `images/` directory for the images produced during exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.
6. Check the `models/` directory for the saved models.

When you run the files, the output of the functions will be printed to the console, and the images produced will be saved in the `images/` directory. The models will be saved in the `models/` directory.
